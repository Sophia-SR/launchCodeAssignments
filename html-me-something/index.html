        </p> In 2011 my Sister and I took a trip through Europe with our family. We made our way through 7 different countries during our month long visit. We started in Paris, and from there went to Germany, Luxembourg, Amsterdam, Brussels, Austria and finally ended up in the Czech Repulic - where we stayed with my Sister's uncle - DJ Big J - for the rest of the month.</p>

     </p>One bright afternoon in Prague along with our Aunt, Grandmother and little cousins we decided to take a short weekend trip to Cesky Krumlov. Cesky Krumlov is a sweet little town, complete with a stately castle and tree-lined river that runs straight through the town centre. On our last day there my Sister, cousins and I were hankering for a daytime activity while our older family members did a bit of pub-hopping. After much deliberation, we decided on what we thought would be a short and leisurely rafting trip down the Vlatva river.</p>

</p>We headed to a rafting company we'd noticed earlier and decided to give it a shot. In our group, only two of us were strong swimmers and only one of us knew how to paddle a raft...Why did we think this was a good idea?</p>

</p>I, being an avid floater and terrible swimmer was extremely hesistant to hop in this rinky looking boat. While the man that ran the whole operation was nice enough, he seeemed very lacksadaisacal about the whole thing - that was unpleasant for me.
The icing on my apprehension cake really piled on when our guide who appeared to be helping us prepare for our rafting journey didn't hop in to the boat as expected. 
</br>
</br>
Unceremoniously, we were given a map and shoved into the water. The trip wasn't as rocky as expected, we got the hang of paddling with help from my rower sister and off we went. The map we were given was either a little confusing or we weren't paying close enough attention. At the stop we were supposed to exit the water, there was a strange lady shore-flopping and rolling around where we were supposed to beach. We couldn't get a good footing and the current took us back to out to the river. As the mountains rose up around us, we became more terrified, we'd left our international phone at the Bed & Breakfast and we had no way to call for help. Our cousins, started to cry, we imagined the woodland animals were stalking us from the shoreline, and I played the 48 hours Mystery storyline - starring us - in my head.

We came upon a group of young people down the river. We got out and took a chance that one of these locals spoke english. No such luck, and they were a little inebriated and thus throughly unhelpful. We hopped back into the boat and took another look at our map, there was only one more campground before the river seemingly opened up to a large lake according to the map for miles. 
</br> 
</br> 
We'd been cruising for a few hours now, and decided we'd get out for sure. When we got to the campground we were relieved to see a large group of people relaxing and ejoying the afternoon. Our jaws dropped, however when we saw a very large confederate flag flying.

Now this might not be unsettling to some, but as the only 4 brown girls in the middle of Cesky Krumlov that was the last thing we expected or desired to see in the middle of the woods Apprehensively, and without much choice in the matter, we got out of the boat. We were greeted by enthusiastic Czech people who didn't speak much english but were intrigued and excited to see Americans - and some of color no less floating down the Vlatva. 
</br> 
</br>
They offered us Coca Cola and water and played the Guitar for us, and though we had some difficulty due to the language barrier, they very kindly called up the park ranger to drive us back to town. The ranger explained to us that the confederate flags represented some group of folks that liked to camp and live off the land there, and didn't really have any connection to american culture. We survived and we are very thankful. Scary stuff. The End.
